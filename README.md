Why do I write it?
--------------

As preparing for the GRE test, especially the vocabulary part following a alphabetic order, with so many words looking just like each other but with different pronunciations, I fell really unconfident about their pronunciation, through recentlly I got a score at 7.5 in IELTS. So I would like to write a small program for myself which I can use to find out pronunciation of different vocabulary. After some days of programming, this is it.

TODO
----
* ✓ check the spelling of the input.
* ✓ take text file `filename.txt` to generate a vocabulary model and save the model in `VocVoc/pickles/`.
* ✓ play the pronunciation of the word(using google's pronunciations).
*   take text files in `corpuses` and automatically train the model and save that.
*   find the word in certain websites' pages and present the context.
